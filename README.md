This is part of the random forest simulation for my dissertation. Any question about the simulation can be addressed to mm19wap@leeds.ac.uk

Abstract:

The random forest has been used in many sectors, especially in the health sector. It has been proven to be useful in the decision process, especially if $p$ is larger than $n$ cases. Random forest application also currently used in the finance sector. One random forest application that often used is feature selection using variable importance. However, the calculation process in the random forest includes analysing a significant data point, possibly millions, and finding the pattern in the data (black box model). The logic behind the model should able to be explained so that the decision process can be accounted for and did not violate any ethical issues. 

This dissertation aims to understand how random forest works, precisely how they behave with different data types. We will look into more detail about feature selection that can be seen from variable importance. The objectives for this dissertation is to understand how random forest variable importance work with the different data types or correlation, especially its application in finance.

This dissertation contains a case study and a series of simulation to understand how the random forest variable importance works on the different data type. The simulation is performed using The continuous, discrete and categorical data. The result showed that random forest able to give understandable importance for the continuous, discrete and categorical data type. However, there are possible issues found in the simulation. For example, when we combine the discrete variable with a different number of trial, the discrete variable seems to eliminate the importance of other variables. Another issue, we have a possible bias with a correlated dataset where the variable that not important, becomes more important as it is correlated with a real high-importance variable. Guidance for applying feature selection in the random forest also explained in the study.
